//! One buyer session, for a program that speaks TollGate on someone else's
//! behalf.
//!
//! `proxyd` (in `tollgate-suite-wrt`) serves phones that run no TollGate
//! software: for each one it holds a session to the gateway, buying at the rate
//! the phone chose out of what the phone paid. That session is an ordinary
//! node — [`Node`], the Spilman backend and the buying algorithm — reduced to
//! what a buyer needs:
//!
//! - one peer, the gateway, dialled and never listened for;
//! - one of two ways to pay, chosen per session ([`Buying`]): time at a speed,
//!   which reserves the rate the caller sets, or pay per use, which reserves
//!   nothing and is drawn only by what the device moves;
//! - no charging it: the session says `no_charge`, so the gateway funds no
//!   channel toward it and the phone needs no mint;
//! - a demand the caller sets, and changes while the session runs;
//! - vouchers from whatever [`Funding`] the caller hands it — the phone's own
//!   budget, not a node's wallet;
//! - optionally a [`Connector`], so the connection comes from the phone's
//!   address and the gateway gates the phone, not the proxy.
